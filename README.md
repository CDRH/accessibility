# Welcome to the CDRH Accessibility Wiki

This is a wiki to help build an accessibility knowledgebase for our web development work. Much of this information is available elsewhere on the web, but the goal of this wiki is to help build CDRH-specific documentation. Besides outlining the basics, this wiki will address specific technologies we use, link to relevant web accessibility resources, and provide examples, templates, and code snippets to support a more standardized structure across CDRH web projects.
