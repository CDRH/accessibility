# Quick Reference for Page Content

## Text
- Page Title
  - `<title>`should be concise and unique to the page content
  - `<h1>` should match the `<title>` (or at least correspond to it). When a page title needs to be long, put the full title in the `<h1>` and use a more concise version for the `<title>`.
- Headings
  - Use "real" headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`)
- Lists
  - Use "real" lists; for example, use a real numbered list rather than plain lines of text
- Links
  - Distinguished from other text by more than just color
  - Use meaningful link text rather than bare URLs
