# CDRH Accessibility Wiki

Welcome to the CDRH Accessibility Wiki! This is a wiki to help build an accessibility knowledgebase for our [web development work](https://github.com/cdrh/) in the [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH)](https://cdrh.unl.edu/) at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln. Much of this information is available elsewhere on the web, so the goal of this wiki is to help build CDRH-specific documentation and curated lists of external resources. Besides outlining the basics, this wiki will address specific technologies we use (such as [Omeka S](technologies/Omeka-S.md)), link to relevant web accessibility resources, and provide examples, templates, and code snippets to support a more standardized structure across CDRH web projects.
